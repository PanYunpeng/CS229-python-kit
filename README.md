# CS229-python-kit
A kit of starter code for CS229 Machine Learning course problem sets

## ðŸš¨DISCLAIMER

1. All the intellectual property belongs to Stanford University and the faculty members who developed the course. The kit is purely for academic purpose.
2. I was careful not to include any content that would constitute academic dishonesty. My code is either a direct translation of the provided MATLAB starter code or just for reading in file or helping in debugging.
   But should any problem arises please feel free to contact me.
3. I make NO guarantee that this kit doesn't contain ANY error that would affect the result. If you encounter any error that is indeed due to the implementation feel free to tell me in the Issue section.

## HW1

### Logistic Regression problem

Data sets

- http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps1/logistic_x.txt
- http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps1/logistic_y.txt

#### Provided

- `utils` for reading logistic files.

### Regression for denoising quasar spectra

Data sets

- [Train set](http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps1/quasar_train.csv)
- [Test set](http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps1/quasar_test.csv)

## HW2

### Spam classification

I could not provide information on this

#### Provided

- `MatrixReader` for reading the matrix file
- `NaiveBayesSpamDetection` and `SVMSpamDetection` are _templates_ to help you get started. Just implement the Naive Bayes and SVM respectively.

### Boosting and high energy physics

[Data set and sample code in MATLAB](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials/boost_data.tgz).

I didn't finish this problem. So it would not be very responsible for me to provide my starter code for this one until I redo it and prove it works.

## HW3

### K-means for compression

The beloved simian images

- http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps3/mandrill-small.tiff
- http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps3/mandrill-large.tiff

#### Provided

`image-compression` is a _template_ that reads in the matrix, and output the compressed image.

## HW4

### Independent Components Analysis

The files are five segments of `.wav` files available on afs.

#### Provided

`bellsej.py` is a skeleton that's basically a line-by-line translation of `bellsej.m`.

### Reinforcement Learning: The inverted pendulum

No data set is required for this task.

#### Provided

`control.py` and `cartpole_sim.py` are direct tranalations of the original simulator and control logic. See the README file under `reinforcement/` for more information.
