# CS229-python-kit
A kit of starter code for CS229 Machine Learning course problem sets

## HW1

### Logistic Regression problem

Data sets

- http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps1/logistic_x.txt
- http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps1/logistic_y.txt

#### Provided

- `utils` for reading logistic files.

### Regression for denoising quasar spectra

Data sets

- [Train set](http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps1/quasar_train.csv)
- [Test set](http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps1/quasar_test.csv)

## HW2

### Spam classification

I could not provide information on this

#### Provided

- `MatrixReader` for reading the matrix file
- `NaiveBayesSpamDetection` and `SVMSpamDetection` are _templates_ to help you get started. Just implement the Naive Bayes and SVM respectively.

### Boosting and high energy physics

[Data set and sample code in MATLAB](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials/boost_data.tgz).

I didn't finish this problem. So it would not be very responsible for me to provide my starter code for this one until I redo it and prove it works.

## HW3

### K-means for compression

The beloved simian images

- http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps3/mandrill-small.tiff
- http://cs229.stanford.edu/ps/ps3/mandrill-large.tiff

#### Provided

`image-compression` is a _template_ that reads in the matrix, and output the compressed image.

## HW4

### Independent Components Analysis

The files are five segments of `.wav` files available on afs.

#### Provided

`bellsej.py` is a skeleton that's basically a line-by-line translation of `bellsej.m`.

### Reinforcement Learning: The inverted pendulum

No data set is required for this task.

#### Provided

`control.py` and `cartpole_sim.py` are direct tranalations of the original simulator and control logic. See the README file under `reinforcement/` for more information.
